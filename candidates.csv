yaswanth veguru,yaswath@gmail.com,536521673,2,Data analyst,hyderabad,python and SQl,"As an expert tech interviewer, I'd be happy to generate some technical questions based on the Python and SQL tech stack. Here are 4 questions that test different levels of experience:

1. **Junior-level question**: Write a Python function that connects to a SQL database and retrieves all the rows from a given table. Assume the table name is 'employees' and it has columns 'id', 'name', and 'department'. The database credentials are 'username', 'password', 'host', and 'database_name'. 

This question tests the candidate's ability to write basic Python code, connect to a SQL database, and perform a simple query.

2. **Mid-level question**: Suppose you have two tables in your SQL database: 'orders' and 'customers'. The 'orders' table has columns 'id', 'customer_id', 'order_date', and 'total_amount', while the 'customers' table has columns 'id', 'name', and 'email'. Write a SQL query that retrieves the customer name, email, and total amount spent by each customer, sorted in descending order by the total amount spent.

This question tests the candidate's ability to write moderately complex SQL queries, join tables, and perform aggregations.

3. **Senior-level question**: Design a Python class that implements a data pipeline to extract data from a SQL database, transform it, and load it into a data warehouse. The class should have methods to connect to the database, extract data, handle errors, and load the transformed data into the data warehouse. Assume the data warehouse is a separate SQL database.

This question tests the candidate's ability to design and implement a complex data pipeline, handle errors, and think about data architecture.

4. **Expert-level question**: Suppose you have a large SQL database with millions of rows, and you need to optimize a query that joins multiple tables and performs aggregations. The query is currently taking several minutes to execute. Describe the steps you would take to optimize the query, including indexing, caching, and rewriting the query. Provide examples of how you would use Python to analyze the query performance and identify bottlenecks.

This question tests the candidate's ability to think critically about query optimization, use advanced SQL techniques, and leverage Python to analyze and improve query performance.

I hope these questions help assess the candidate's skills and experience with Python and SQL!"
eddq33e12,raju@gmail.com,8765432763,1,data scientist,hyd,python,"As an expert tech interviewer, I'd be happy to generate some technical questions for a Python developer. Here are 4 questions that test different levels of experience:

1. **Junior-level question**: Write a Python function that takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list. This question tests the candidate's understanding of basic Python data structures, control structures, and functions. For example, I'd expect the candidate to use a for loop to iterate over the list and a conditional statement to check if each number is even.

2. **Mid-level question**: Implement a Python class that represents a simple bank account. The class should have attributes for account number, account holder's name, and balance. It should also have methods to deposit and withdraw money, and to check the current balance. This question tests the candidate's understanding of object-oriented programming concepts in Python, such as classes, objects, and inheritance. I'd expect the candidate to use a class definition to define the BankAccount class, and to use methods to implement the deposit, withdraw, and check_balance functionality.

3. **Senior-level question**: Write a Python program that uses the `concurrent.futures` module to parallelize the execution of a function that performs some I/O-bound operation, such as reading a file or making an HTTP request. This question tests the candidate's understanding of concurrent programming in Python, including the use of threads, processes, and futures. For example, I'd expect the candidate to use the `ThreadPoolExecutor` or `ProcessPoolExecutor` class to create a pool of worker threads or processes, and to use the `submit` method to schedule the execution of the I/O-bound function.

4. **Expert-level question**: Implement a Python decorator that uses the `functools` module to memoize the results of a function, so that if the function is called again with the same arguments, it returns the cached result instead of recomputing it. This question tests the candidate's understanding of advanced Python concepts, such as decorators, closures, and memoization. I'd expect the candidate to use the `@functools.lru_cache` decorator to implement the memoization functionality, and to use a dictionary to store the cached results.

These questions cover a range of topics and difficulty levels, from basic programming concepts to advanced topics like concurrency and memoization. Do you want me to elaborate on any of these questions or provide sample answers?"
Prasad,prasad@gmail.com,234567856,1,data scientist,Benguluru,"java,javascript","As an expert tech interviewer, I'd be happy to generate some technical questions based on the given tech stack of Java and JavaScript. Here are 4 questions that test different levels of experience:

1. **Junior-level question**: Write a Java function to reverse a singly linked list. The function should take the head of the list as input and return the head of the reversed list. Please provide a step-by-step explanation of your approach and any relevant code snippets. (This question tests basic data structures and algorithmic thinking.)

2. **Mid-level question**: Suppose you're building a web application using JavaScript, and you need to optimize the performance of a function that makes multiple API calls to fetch data. Describe a strategy to implement caching for these API calls, including the data structures you'd use and any relevant JavaScript features (e.g., Service Workers, localStorage). How would you handle cache invalidation and expiration? (This question tests knowledge of web development, performance optimization, and caching strategies.)

3. **Senior-level question**: Design a scalable architecture for a real-time collaboration platform using Java as the backend and JavaScript as the frontend. The platform should support multiple users editing a document simultaneously, with features like cursor tracking, document versioning, and conflict resolution. Describe the key components of your architecture, including any relevant technologies (e.g., WebSockets, WebRTC), data models, and algorithms for handling concurrent updates. (This question tests system design skills, scalability, and concurrency management.)

4. **Expert-level question**: Suppose you're tasked with migrating a legacy Java application to a cloud-native, serverless architecture using a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platform like AWS Lambda. Describe the steps you'd take to refactor the application, including any necessary changes to the code, data models, and deployment scripts. How would you handle concerns like cold starts, memory limits, and function timeouts, and what strategies would you use to monitor and debug the application in a serverless environment? (This question tests knowledge of cloud computing, serverless architecture, and migration strategies.)

These questions should give you a good starting point to assess the candidate's skills and experience with the Java and JavaScript tech stack. Do you want me to adjust the difficulty level or add more questions?"
